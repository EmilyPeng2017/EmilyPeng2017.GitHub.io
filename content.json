Being buried in work often makes my body feel heavy, but running gives me a much-needed reset. The first 3 km is always the hardest, but once I push through, I feel lighter by the 5 km mark, and even start to pick up speed. Today’s weather was delightful, with a light drizzle in Brugge (which I actually enjoy ^_^). The fresh air felt rejuvenating, and during my run, I came across a family of coots, along with pigeons, seagulls, and a variety of other birds I couldn’t name.

These sensors enable customizable conductivity, layer thickness, and sensor dimensions, paving the way for advanced applications in flexible electronics. ❓ Research GapFlexible pressure sensors have seen significant advancements, particularly through material optimization and innovative 3D printing techniques. However: ⚡ Most studies focus on low graphene content composites. 🔧 Few have explored tunable sensors with adjustable properties like conductivity and layer structure. 🚫 A need remains for high graphene content composites for enhanced functionality. 💡 Key Insights🌟 Edge Functionalized Expanded Graphene (EFXG)EFXG, derived from expanded graphite, exhibits: ✅ High solvent dispersibility (100 mg/ml). 🔬 Excellent potential for enhancing composite properties in 3D printing applications. ⚙️ Methods🛠 ProblemIncorporating graphene into Sylgard 184 (a PDMS material) during simultaneous mixing of all components led to poor crosslinking when graphene content exceeded 5 wt.%. 🧪 SolutionA two-step process was developed: 🔄 Mixing and Pre-Crosslinking: Combine Sylgard 184 prepolymer and initiator, then heat at 60°C for 1 hour to initiate crosslinking. ➕ Graphene Addition: Introduce graphene post-initiation to reduce its hindering effect on the crosslinking process. 📊 Results 📏 Printability Limitation: Graphene content exceeding 12% caused unprintable viscosity levels. ⚡ High Conductivity: Composites with 60% graphene achieved superior electrical performance. 🎨 Questions for myself What is Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Raman Spectroscopy used for? FTIR: A technique used to identify organic, polymeric, and some inorganic materials by measuring how different wavelengths of infrared light are absorbed by the material, providing information about molecular bonds and functional groups. Raman Spectroscopy: Complements FTIR by measuring inelastic scattering of light to identify vibrational modes of molecules, providing insights into molecular structures, crystallinity, and chemical composition. What is Newtonian behavior? Newtonian Behavior: Refers to fluids whose viscosity remains constant regardless of the applied shear rate or stress. Examples include water and most simple oils. What is the relationship between viscosity and shear rate? For Newtonian fluids, viscosity is constant and independent of shear rate. For non-Newtonian fluids, viscosity changes with shear rate: Shear-thinning (pseudoplastic): Viscosity decreases as shear rate increases (e.g., ketchup). Shear-thickening (dilatant): Viscosity increases as shear rate increases (e.g., cornstarch in water). What is viscoelasticity? What is loss modulus and storage modulus? Viscoelasticity: A material property where the substance exhibits both viscous (fluid-like) and elastic (solid-like) behavior under deformation. Loss Modulus (G’’): Represents the energy dissipated as heat (viscous component). Storage Modulus (G’): Represents the energy stored and recovered per cycle (elastic component). What is the recovery behavior of printing ink under stress? Is it necessary to test all the above properties? Recovery Behavior: Refers to the ability of ink to regain its original structure after stress is removed, crucial for maintaining print quality during and after extrusion. Testing recovery behavior helps evaluate print fidelity. Testing all properties depends on the application requirements. For high-precision applications, it’s often necessary to test rheological and viscoelastic properties. What microscopy and morphology tests have they done? Common techniques include Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for surface topography and structural details, and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) for nanoscale surface characterization. Additional tests may involve Optical Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for detailed internal morphology. What is gauge factor? Gauge Factor (GF): The ratio of relative change in electrical resistance to the mechanical strain applied to a material. It’s a key parameter for evaluating the sensitivity of strain sensors. 🗣 DiscussionThe temperature-induced crosslinking approach effectively addresses challenges posed by high graphene content. This study demonstrates how tailored 3D-printed composites can unlock new possibilities in flexible pressure sensor design. 🌟 Personal InsightsThis paper inspired me to think about the balance between material composition and manufacturing techniques.

This book is a treasure trove for anyone eager to build practical machine learning and deep learning skills using Python libraries like Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow. My goal is to: Understand and implement the algorithms discussed in the book. Apply these algorithms to solve real-world problems (haha, of course related to my research, stay tuned!!😁). Each post in this series will explore a specific chapter or concept, enriched with: Practical code examples 🖥️ Key insights 💡 Lessons learned along the way 🛠️ 📝 Key TakeawaysWhen is Machine Learning particularly useful?Machine learning shines in the following scenarios: 1️⃣ Problems with complex or variable rulesWhen existing solutions require: Extensive fine-tuning Long, hard-to-maintain rule sets 2️⃣ Challenges where traditional methods failWhen conventional programming approaches struggle to deliver a good solution. 3️⃣ Dynamic or fluctuating environmentsWhen systems need to adapt to: Changing conditions Evolving data patterns 4️⃣ Analyzing complex or massive datasetsMachine learning can extract meaningful insights from: Large volumes of data 📊 Highly intricate problem domains 🌐 📚 Types of Machine Learning SystemsTraining SupervisionClassifying machine learning systems based on how they are supervised during training: Supervised Learning Principle: The training set includes the desired solutions, called labels. Examples: A labeled training set for spam classification. Predicting a target numeric value (a regression problem). Unsupervised Learning Principle: The training data is unlabeled, and the system learns without a teacher. Examples: Clustering algorithms to detect groups of similar blog visitors. Visualization algorithms that process complex unlabeled data into 2D/3D plots. Anomaly detection. Association rule learning: Discovering interesting relations between attributes in large datasets. Semi-Supervised Learning Principle: Combines a few labeled instances with a large number of unlabeled ones, reducing the cost and effort of labeling. Examples: Some photo-hosting services. Algorithms that blend supervised and unsupervised techniques. Self-Supervised Learning Principle: Generates labeled data from an unlabeled dataset, enabling supervised learning techniques to be applied. Examples: Repairing damaged images or erasing unwanted objects from pictures. Reinforcement Learning Principle: An agent learns by interacting with the environment, performing actions, and receiving rewards or penalties. Examples: Robots learning how to walk. DeepMind’s AlphaGo. Batch vs. Online LearningClassifying systems based on whether they learn incrementally from incoming data: Batch Learning Principle: Requires all data at once; cannot learn incrementally. Key Features: Also called offline learning: Trained first, then deployed without further learning. Pros: Simple and often effective. Cons: Time-intensive and resource-heavy. Online Learning Principle: Learns incrementally by sequentially processing data (individually or in mini-batches). Key Features: Pros: Adapts quickly to changing environments; works on systems with limited resources. Cons: Prone to degradation if fed with poor-quality data. Generalization ApproachesInstance-Based Learning Principle: Memorizes examples and generalizes to new cases using similarity measures. Model-Based Learning Principle: Builds a model of the examples and uses it for predictions. 🎯 Main Challenges in Machine Learning Insufficient Training Data: Small datasets may not represent the problem well. Nonrepresentative Data: The data may fail to capture the true distribution. Poor-Quality Data: Cleaning the training data can greatly improve results. Irrelevant Features: Feature selection is crucial for model success. Overfitting: The model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. Underfitting: The model fails to capture the complexity of the data. 🔍 Testing and Validating Models Data Splitting: Divide data into training and test sets. Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Selection: Fine-tune parameters to improve performance. No Free Lunch Theorem If no assumptions are made about the data, there’s no reason to prefer one model over another.","link":"/2025/01/01/ML-Ch1-The-Machine-Learning-Landscape/"},{"title":"Regulating Emotions: Invasive or Non-invasive?","text":"This month, I attended the 21st International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks (EWSN’24) in Abu Dhabi. It was quite an eventful experience for several reasons: 1. A Challenging Business TripThis was my first time traveling for work with a colleague, and it made me realize how much I still need to improve when working alongside others. The trip wasn’t without its challenges, my colleague had a high fever during the conference, and I experienced acclimatization issues from the second day, which left me vomiting the entire night. After returning to Belgium, I came down with a high fever for two days, during which I was bedridden and barely conscious. Ending the year in such a way was definitely a unique experience, though not one I’d want to repeat! 2. Exploring Abu DhabiDespite the challenges, I managed to enjoy some of Abu Dhabi’s highlights. I saw a stunning desert sunset, went on a desert safari, rode a camel, and visited the breathtaking Sheikh Zayed Mosque. However, I realized I’m a bit of a sentimental traveler. I always feel something is missing when I can’t share these experiences with my husband or close friends. That said, Abu Dhabi is a fantastic place to visit, and I found myself wishing several times that my husband could have been there to experience it with me. 3. Thoughts on the Conference As a relatively new researcher, every conference I attend leaves me with a strong urge to return to my lab and dive into experiments. At times, I find the social aspects of these events overwhelming or even somewhat meaningless because I feel I’m not yet strong enough to collaborate effectively with others. A voice in my head constantly tells me, “Work harder, Emily!”. AI and machine learning dominated much of the research presented at the conference, which initially felt discouraging since these aren’t my areas of expertise. However, I’ve resolved not to fall behind. If AI is a valuable tool, I need to familiarize myself with it and find ways to integrate it into my work. As a first step, I’ve added “learning machine learning” to my 2025 to-do list, and I’m determined to make progress in this field. One of the keynotes I was most excited about was “Sensory Interventions: Real-time integration of passive sensing and adaptive passive interventions” by Prof. Tanzeem Choudhury from Cornell Tech. While I had high expectations for this presentation, I must admit I left feeling a bit disappointed. The speaker only briefly touched upon the subject and didn’t delve into the detailed or advanced technologies I was hoping to learn more about. However, I understand that this is often the nature of a conference keynote During the Q&amp;A session, I asked whether heart rate was the only parameter they used to assess emotion and whether they had considered any invasive sensing methods. The answer was “yes” and “no.” I couldn’t help but think about how deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery has already been verified as a promising approach to treating depression [1]. To me, it seems like DBS represents the gold standard for addressing emotional disorders. By comparison, their team’s non-invasive approach, relying solely on heart rate, initially felt overly simplistic and limited. However, after reflecting on it, I realized their method has its merits. For cases that are not treatment-resistant depression, why not explore simpler, non-invasive ways to address the problem? If it works, it could be an accessible and practical solution for many people. Interestingly, this aligns with what I aim to achieve for diabetic patients—finding effective, non-invasive methods to improve their quality of life.

But as someone with a terrible sense of direction, I somehow ended up going the wrong way, and once I realized it, I had no choice but to keep going. So, 15 km it was! ORZ! What started as a routine run turned into an unexpected adventure when I found myself in an unfamiliar area that looked like a cluster of factories. I’m sorry but I really like taking photos &gt;_&lt;. I couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. There I was, stopping every few minutes to snap pictures, feeling like a spy on a secret mission. The weather wasn’t ideal. It was a bit chilly, and the skies were far from clear. But despite the less-than-perfect conditions, running always has a way of grounding me.

I picked up some fresh fruits and a beautiful flower for a colleague. Later in the afternoon, I met with a group of Chinese colleagues and made dumplings together. The weather today was absolutely perfect. The sun shone brightly, casting a golden glow over everything, and the world seemed to hum with joy. The trees proudly displayed their light green leaves, the river sparkled as if singing a gentle melody, and a soft breeze carried a touch of magic through the fresh air. But the true highlight of my day was an enchanting encounter with a little bird, a robin! I first fell in love with robins when I saw one on the M&amp;S cookie box. They’re such adorable birds-small, round, and plump, like little furry balls. While they’re quite common here in Bruges, they’re usually shy and quick to dart into the bushes, making it hard to get a good look or take a photo. But today, something magical happened. While I was running, a robin actually stopped to say hi! It was such a clever and curious little bird, it didn’t seem afraid of me at all. It perched on a tree branch and just stared at me, as if waiting for me to notice it. Me: “Stay right there, please! Let me take your picture.”Robin: “Okay, but make it a good one!”Me: “Hmm, you’re a bit too far. Can you come a little closer?”Robin (flying closer): “How about now?” We stood there together under the warm sunshine, and for a moment, it felt like we understood each other.

For instance, taking the subway in Shanghai typically costs only 4 to 6 RMB (approximately €0.5 to €0.8). That’s pocket change! 🤑 As someone used to this cost-efficiency, traveling in Belgium, or any other European country, feels like public transport is reaching directly into my wallet! 😂💸 The Brussels Airport Supplement: My “Door Shock” Moment 🚪😱So, imagine my reaction when I discovered the infamous Brussels Airport Supplement! I was shocked to learn that I needed to buy an additional ticket just to access the airport via train. That’s right, this isn’t about your regular train fare; it’s an extra charge simply to go through the “airport door.” 🤑 Talk about an expensive entrance fee! 😬✈️ Screenshot of the SNCB supplement ticket. Why Is There a Supplement? 💡After some digging, I discovered that this charge is linked to the Diabolo Project, which simplifies train connections to Brussels Airport for people in cities like Antwerp, Leuven, and Namur. Here’s how it works: Public/Private Partnership: The Diabolo Project is funded by Northern Diabolo NV through a public-private model. User-Pays Principle: The cost of this project is passed directly to passengers who use it, via a supplement added to your train ticket. Good News for Non-Users: If you don’t take the train to the airport, you don’t have to pay for this infrastructure. Fair enough, right? 🤔 You can read more about the supplement on the SNCB portal. The China Difference 🇨🇳💰🚇In contrast, public transportation in China operates on a heavily subsidized model, making it accessible to everyone. Whether you’re a daily commuter or an occasional traveler, the government ensures that public transport remains affordable and inclusive. For example: Subsidized Infrastructure: Massive investments in metro systems don’t directly impact ticket prices. Flat or Low Pricing: Even premium routes like airport express trains cost far less compared to European standards. A Global Perspective 🌍Interestingly, similar supplement tickets exist at other airports worldwide, such as Copenhagen Airport, Frankfurt Airport, and Oslo Airport. These charges are often justified by specific infrastructure projects or enhancements aimed at improving airport connectivity. If I get the chance to travel more, I’d love to explore how these systems compare! ✈️🛤️ While the user-pays model in Belgium is logical, it ensures that only those who use the service cover its costs, it contrasts sharply with China’s government-funded approach. Each has its merits, but I must admit, my wallet definitely misses China’s affordable transport! 😅💼 One question lingers in my mind: if projects like Diabolo earn enough money over time, for example, after ten years, when ticket revenue covers the project’s expenses, will they still charge the supplement? Or will it be removed? 🫣🫣","link":"/2025/01/13/Why-do-we-need-to-pay-Brussels-Airport-Supplement/"},{"title":"eWEAR Seminar: AI insights from wearable sensors_Stanford University","text":"Tonight, I had the opportunity to remotely attend a seminar held at Stanford University, where two insightful presentations shed light on advancements in wearable sensors.

It left me reflecting on a conversation we had not long ago. It was a typical day when I returned to my studio and stopped by my landlord’s place to pick up a package. We started chatting casually, and he asked me, “Why do you always work so late, Emily?” I laughed and replied, “Well, probably because I’m not that smart.” As the conversation flowed, I shared details about my project. He seemed genuinely intrigued and, in turn, shared a deeply personal story about his mother. She had been diagnosed with diabetic foot several years ago. From what I know, the prognosis is grim once diabetic foot is discovered. It’s often already too late for effective treatment. His mother was over 90 years old, making surgery an impossible option. He mentioned that the family was considering euthanasia for her. I was surprised to learn that euthanasia is legal in Belgium. It’s a humane option for those suffering, but hearing it from someone I know gave me a new perspective on its profound impact. I never thought the day he mentioned would come so soon.
