It was quite an eventful experience for several reasons: 1. A Challenging Business TripThis was my first time traveling for work with a colleague, and it made me realize how much I still need to improve when working alongside others. The trip wasn’t without its challenges, my colleague had a high fever during the conference, and I experienced acclimatization issues from the second day, which left me vomiting the entire night. After returning to Belgium, I came down with a high fever for two days, during which I was bedridden and barely conscious. Ending the year in such a way was definitely a unique experience, though not one I’d want to repeat! 2. Exploring Abu DhabiDespite the challenges, I managed to enjoy some of Abu Dhabi’s highlights. I saw a stunning desert sunset, went on a desert safari, rode a camel, and visited the breathtaking Sheikh Zayed Mosque. However, I realized I’m a bit of a sentimental traveler. I always feel something is missing when I can’t share these experiences with my husband or close friends. That said, Abu Dhabi is a fantastic place to visit, and I found myself wishing several times that my husband could have been there to experience it with me. 3. Thoughts on the Conference As a relatively new researcher, every conference I attend leaves me with a strong urge to return to my lab and dive into experiments. At times, I find the social aspects of these events overwhelming or even somewhat meaningless because I feel I’m not yet strong enough to collaborate effectively with others. A voice in my head constantly tells me, “Work harder, Emily!”. AI and machine learning dominated much of the research presented at the conference, which initially felt discouraging since these aren’t my areas of expertise. However, I’ve resolved not to fall behind. If AI is a valuable tool, I need to familiarize myself with it and find ways to integrate it into my work. As a first step, I’ve added “learning machine learning” to my 2025 to-do list, and I’m determined to make progress in this field. One of the keynotes I was most excited about was “Sensory Interventions: Real-time integration of passive sensing and adaptive passive interventions” by Prof. Tanzeem Choudhury from Cornell Tech. While I had high expectations for this presentation, I must admit I left feeling a bit disappointed. The speaker only briefly touched upon the subject and didn’t delve into the detailed or advanced technologies I was hoping to learn more about. However, I understand that this is often the nature of a conference keynote During the Q&amp;A session, I asked whether heart rate was the only parameter they used to assess emotion and whether they had considered any invasive sensing methods. The answer was “yes” and “no.” I couldn’t help but think about how deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery has already been verified as a promising approach to treating depression [1]. To me, it seems like DBS represents the gold standard for addressing emotional disorders. By comparison, their team’s non-invasive approach, relying solely on heart rate, initially felt overly simplistic and limited. However, after reflecting on it, I realized their method has its merits. For cases that are not treatment-resistant depression, why not explore simpler, non-invasive ways to address the problem? If it works, it could be an accessible and practical solution for many people. Interestingly, this aligns with what I aim to achieve for diabetic patients—finding effective, non-invasive methods to improve their quality of life.

This book is a treasure trove for anyone eager to build practical machine learning and deep learning skills using Python libraries like Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow. My goal is to: Understand and implement the algorithms discussed in the book. Apply these algorithms to solve real-world problems (haha, of course related to my research, stay tuned!!😁). Each post in this series will explore a specific chapter or concept, enriched with: Practical code examples 🖥️ Key insights 💡 Lessons learned along the way 🛠️ 📝 Key TakeawaysWhen is Machine Learning particularly useful?Machine learning shines in the following scenarios: 1️⃣ Problems with complex or variable rulesWhen existing solutions require: Extensive fine-tuning Long, hard-to-maintain rule sets 2️⃣ Challenges where traditional methods failWhen conventional programming approaches struggle to deliver a good solution. 3️⃣ Dynamic or fluctuating environmentsWhen systems need to adapt to: Changing conditions Evolving data patterns 4️⃣ Analyzing complex or massive datasetsMachine learning can extract meaningful insights from: Large volumes of data 📊 Highly intricate problem domains 🌐 📚 Types of Machine Learning SystemsTraining SupervisionClassifying machine learning systems based on how they are supervised during training: Supervised Learning Principle: The training set includes the desired solutions, called labels. Examples: A labeled training set for spam classification. Predicting a target numeric value (a regression problem). Unsupervised Learning Principle: The training data is unlabeled, and the system learns without a teacher. Examples: Clustering algorithms to detect groups of similar blog visitors. Visualization algorithms that process complex unlabeled data into 2D/3D plots. Anomaly detection. Association rule learning: Discovering interesting relations between attributes in large datasets. Semi-Supervised Learning Principle: Combines a few labeled instances with a large number of unlabeled ones, reducing the cost and effort of labeling. Examples: Some photo-hosting services. Algorithms that blend supervised and unsupervised techniques. Self-Supervised Learning Principle: Generates labeled data from an unlabeled dataset, enabling supervised learning techniques to be applied. Examples: Repairing damaged images or erasing unwanted objects from pictures. Reinforcement Learning Principle: An agent learns by interacting with the environment, performing actions, and receiving rewards or penalties. Examples: Robots learning how to walk. DeepMind’s AlphaGo. Batch vs. Online LearningClassifying systems based on whether they learn incrementally from incoming data: Batch Learning Principle: Requires all data at once; cannot learn incrementally. Key Features: Also called offline learning: Trained first, then deployed without further learning. Pros: Simple and often effective. Cons: Time-intensive and resource-heavy. Online Learning Principle: Learns incrementally by sequentially processing data (individually or in mini-batches). Key Features: Pros: Adapts quickly to changing environments; works on systems with limited resources. Cons: Prone to degradation if fed with poor-quality data. Generalization ApproachesInstance-Based Learning Principle: Memorizes examples and generalizes to new cases using similarity measures. Model-Based Learning Principle: Builds a model of the examples and uses it for predictions. 🎯 Main Challenges in Machine Learning Insufficient Training Data: Small datasets may not represent the problem well. Nonrepresentative Data: The data may fail to capture the true distribution. Poor-Quality Data: Cleaning the training data can greatly improve results. Irrelevant Features: Feature selection is crucial for model success. Overfitting: The model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. Underfitting: The model fails to capture the complexity of the data. 🔍 Testing and Validating Models Data Splitting: Divide data into training and test sets. Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Selection: Fine-tune parameters to improve performance. No Free Lunch Theorem If no assumptions are made about the data, there’s no reason to prefer one model over another.","link":"/2025/01/01/ML-Ch1-The-Machine-Learning-Landscape/"},{"title":"0_3D-printed PDMS&#x2F;Graphene sensors with tunable sensitivity","text":"🚀 3D-Printed PDMS/Graphene Sensors with Tunable Sensitivity🗓 Published on: Dec. 2024📚 Journal/Conference: Advanced Electron Materials 🔍 AbstractThis study introduces PDMS/Graphene composites with high graphene content, formulated into printing ink for the fabrication of tunable multilayer pressure sensors via 3D printing.

No person has ever been completely himself, but each one strives to become so, some gropingly, others more lucidly, according to his abilities.” — Hermann Hesse, Demian Who am IHi, I’m PENG Sai (彭赛), and I also go by my English name, Emily, which I chose back in middle school. I’m a Ph.D. researcher at KU Leuven in Belgium, exploring topics like embedded systems, wearable devices, smart sensors, and soft robotics. My ultimate goal is to develop technologies that make a real difference in healthcare and rehabilitation. Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I worked at Microsoft and Micron. Back then, I felt like a ship adrift, chasing milestones like earning money, getting married, buying a house, and climbing the career ladder, but without a true sense of purpose. The COVID-19 lockdown gave me the time to work from home and reflect on life’s bigger questions. It was during this period that I decided to pursue a Ph.D. Witnessing the struggles of a loved one battling cancer and the many heartbreaking stories I encountered at the hospital further solidified my resolve to contribute meaningfully to the world. Why this siteI’ve been blogging since 2012, starting on CSDN, then transitioning to a Chinese public account, and eventually to GitHub. Writing has always been a personal joy for me, a way to document my thoughts and, with luck, connect with others who share similar interests. This site serves a few key purposes: Showcasing my independent research and its outcomes Documenting my personal achievements Highlighting the challenges I aim to tackle Exploring and discussing wearable and smart devices, along with their real-world applications I may not have the answer to life’s ultimate question, but I know I’m on a journey that brings me fulfillment.
